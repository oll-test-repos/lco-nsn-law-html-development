                </p>
                <p>This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the inherent sovereign authority of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians to provide for the decent, safe and sanitary dwellings for the members of the Tribe which predates its Treaties of 1825, 1826, 1837, 1842, 1847 and 1854 with the United States Government. In the implementation of this inherent sovereign authority, Article V, §§ 1 (l) and (m) of the Amended Constitution and Bylaws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, empowers the Tribal Governing Board to: "organize, charter and regulate any association or group, including a housing authority, for the purpose of providing social or economic benefits to the members of the Band or residents of the reservation" Article V, § 1 (l);  and "delegate to subordinate boards, officers, committees or cooperative associations which are open to all members of the Band any of the foregoing powers, reserving the right to review any action taken by virtue of such delegated powers" Article V, § 1 (m). Pursuant to this inherent sovereign authority, the Tribal Governing Board hereby establishes a public body known as the Lac Courte Oreilles Housing Authority (hereinafter referred to as the Housing Authority), and enacts this ordinance which shall establish the purposes, powers and duties of the Housing Authority. In any suit, action or proceeding involving the validity or enforcement of or relating to any of its contracts, the Housing Authority shall be conclusively deemed to have become established and authorized to transact business and exercise its powers upon proof of the adoption of this ordinance. A copy of this ordinance duly certified by the Secretary/Treasurer of the Tribal Governing Board shall be admissible in evidence in any suit, action or proceedings.</p>

                <p>The purpose of this Subchapter is to set forth the guidelines and procedures related to the temporary relocation of housing participants by the Housing Authority. These guidelines are established as a result of 49 CFR Part 24 - Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Regulations for Federal and Federally Assisted Programs (hereinafter "URA"). Prior to HUD approval for any grant, contract; or agreement requiring relocation activity under which federal funds provide financial assistance, the Housing Authority must provide a certification of compliance that it will comply with the URA. The Housing Authority will take appropriate measures to carry out the requirements contained in this policy in a manner that minimizes fraud, waste, and mismanagement. Instances of fraud and waste will be handled appropriately by the Housing Authority or referred to HUD's Office of Inspector General.</p>
