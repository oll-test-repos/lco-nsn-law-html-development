                <p>This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the inherent sovereign authority of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians relating to the operation of the Tribal Government and the delivery of governmental services which predates its Treaties of 1825, 1826, 1837, 1842, 1847 and 1854 with the United States Government. In the implementation of this inherent sovereign authority, Articles III and V of the Amended Constitution and Bylaws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, empowers the Tribal Governing Board to: "determine its own procedures" Article III, § 6; and "to regulate, by enactment of ordinances, the conduct of business within the territory of the Band," Article V, § 1 (n). The Lac Courte Oreilles Tribal Government is founded on the consent of the governed. The citizens of the Tribe are entitled to have complete confidence in the loyalty and integrity of their Elected Officials. To that end this ordinance establishes clear standards of ethical conduct and behavior of the Elected Officials to the Tribal Governing Board. This ordinance seeks to require accountability to the citizens of the Tribe by the Tribal Governing Board in exercising the authority vested with them. It is the intention of the Tribal Governing Board that the provisions of this ordinance be construed and applied in each instance, so as to accomplish its purpose in protecting the Tribe's citizens from government decisions and actions resulting from, or affected by, undue influence or conflict of interest.</p>

                </p>
                <p>This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the inherent sovereign authority of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians relating to the delivery of educational services which predates its Treaties of 1825, 1826, 1837, 1842, 1847 and 1854 with the United States Government. In the implementation of this inherent sovereign authority, Article V, §§ 1(l) and (m) of the Amended Constitution and Bylaws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, empowers the Tribal Governing Board to: "organize, charter and regulate any association or group, including a housing authority, for the purpose of providing social or economic benefits to the members of the Band or residents of the reservation" Article V, § 1 (l);  and "delegate to subordinate boards, officers, committees or cooperative associations which are open to all members of the Band any of the foregoing powers, reserving the right to review any action taken by virtue of such delegated powers" Article V, § 1 (m). This ordinance establishes that the purpose of the Lac Courte Oreilles Ojibwe Early Head Start ("Early Head Start") program is to provide students a comprehensive, bilingual and multicultural community-based education that nurtures theirs intellectual, spiritual, physical, emotional, mental and social development.</p>
