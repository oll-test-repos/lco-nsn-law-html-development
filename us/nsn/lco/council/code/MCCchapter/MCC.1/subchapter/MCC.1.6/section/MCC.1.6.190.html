                <p>Elected Officials may be eligible for up to twelve (12) weeks of family and medical leave during any twelve (12) month period. The leave may be paid, unpaid, or a combination of paid and unpaid, depending on the circumstances. This policy sets forth the Tribe's policies and procedures for requesting family and medical leave.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> <u>Eligibility for Leave</u>. To be eligible for family and medical leave under this policy all of the following conditions must be met:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> An Elected Official must have been elected or employed with the Tribe or a Tribal Entity for at least twelve (12) months or fifty-two (52) weeks.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> An Elected Official must have been elected or employed with the Tribe or a Tribal Entity and worked at least one thousand two hundred fifty (1250) hours during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the request for leave.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> <u>Reasons for Requesting and Types of Leave</u>. Elected Officials who are eligible for leave under this policy may request up to twelve (12) workweeks of unpaid leave during any twelve (12) month period for the following reasons:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> To care for a child following the child's birth or placement for adoption or foster care (this may be taken only within twelve (12) months of the birth or placement).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> To care for an immediate family member who has a serious health condition as defined in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/lco/council/code/MCCchapter/MCC.1/subchapter/MCC.1.2/section/MCC.1.2.010#(k)" title="">Section MCC.1.2.010(k)</a> of this manual.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)">(3)</span> Because the Elected Official has a serious health condition as defined in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/lco/council/code/MCCchapter/MCC.1/subchapter/MCC.1.2/section/MCC.1.2.010#(k)" title="">Section MCC.1.2.010(k)</a> of this manual, which prevents the Elected Official from performing the functions of office.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> If an Elected Official takes PTO for a condition that progresses into a serious health condition and the Elected Official requests unpaid leave as provided under this policy, the Tribe may designate all or some portion of related leave taken as leave under this policy, to the extent that the earlier leave meets the necessary qualifications.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Elected Officials can take up to twelve (12) weeks of leave under this policy during any twelve (12) month period. The Tribe will measure the twelve (12) month period as a rolling twelve (12) month period measured backward from the date an Elected Official uses any leave under this policy. Each time an Elected Official takes a leave, the Tribe will compute the amount of leave the Elected Official has taken under this ordinance and subtract it from the twelve (12) weeks of available leave, and the balance remaining is the amount the Elected Official is entitled to take at that time. An Elected Official's family or medical leave taken may run concurrently with other types of leave including workers' compensation and other leaves, such as short-term or long-term disability, etc.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> <u>Intermittent or Reduced Work Schedule Leave</u>. Leaves may be taken all at once or on an intermittent or reduced work schedule basis. Intermittent or reduced work schedules may be used only in the following circumstances:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)">(1)</span> In situations where leave is requested due to the birth, adoption or acceptance of a child in foster care, intermittent or reduced work schedules will be granted at the sole discretion of the Tribal Governing Board and if granted must be taken within one (1) year of the birth or placement of the child.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)">(2)</span> In situations where leave is requested in order to care for an immediate family member who suffers from a serious health condition or because of an Elected Official's own serious health condition, intermittent or reduced work schedules will be granted only when an Elected Official can prove to the Tribal Governing Board that the leave is medically necessary.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> <u>Use of Paid and Unpaid Leave</u>. Elected Officials who have accrued PTO must use paid leave first and take the remainder of the twelve (12) weeks as unpaid leave.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(1)">(1)</span> Elected Officials who take a leave because of their own serious health condition or the serious health condition of a family member must use all accumulated PTO prior to being eligible for unpaid leave.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(2)">(2)</span> Elected Officials who take leave for the birth of a child must use paid PTO for physical recovery following childbirth, except where such leave is compensated as paid maternity leave under this ordinance or as paid short-term or long-term disability leave. These Elected Officials must then use all paid vacation, and then will be eligible for unpaid leave for the remainder of the twelve (12) weeks. Elected Officials who take leave for the adoption or acceptance of a child in foster care must use all paid PTO prior to being eligible for unpaid leave.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> <u>Procedure for Requesting Leave</u>. In situations where leave is foreseeable, Elected Officials must provide written notice to Tribal Governing Board at least thirty (30) days prior to the date on which the leave is scheduled to begin. If the leave is foreseeable due to a planned medical treatment, Elected Officials must make reasonable efforts to schedule the treatment(s) to minimize disruptions to governmental operations. If circumstances occur, in which it is not practicable to provide thirty (30) days' notice, Elected Officials must provide written notice as far in advance as is practicable. If an Elected Officials fails to provide thirty (30) days advance written notice of a requested leave and have no reasonable excuse, the leave may at the Tribal Governing Board's discretion be delayed for up to thirty (30) days from the date of written notice.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(h)">(h)</span> <u>Medical Certification Requirement</u>. When leave is requested because of a serious health condition affecting an Elected Official or his or her immediate family member, the Tribe requires the Elected Official to obtain certification of the health condition from the pertinent doctor or health care provider. This certification must be provided to the Tribal Governing Board within fifteen (15) days after the leave is requested or, when the need for leave was unforeseeable, within fifteen (15) days after the leave has commenced unless it is not practicable to do because of the nature of the health condition.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(1)">(1)</span> If an Elected Official seeking leave due to a serious health condition fails to provide the required medical certification, the leave will be denied until the certification is provided. If the leave request was not foreseeable, such as in a medical emergency, the failure to provide the required medical certification within a reasonable time may result in the denial of continuation of leave. Medical certification provided in justification of a request for leave must include the following information:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(1)(A)">(A)</span> The date on which the serious health condition started and its expected duration,</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(1)(B)">(B)</span> The diagnosis concerning the condition,</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(1)(C)">(C)</span> A brief description of the treatment prescribed for the condition,</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(1)(D)">(D)</span> A statement of whether in-patient hospitalization is required, or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(1)(E)">(E)</span> A statement that the Elected Official is needed to care for his or her immediate family member afflicted with a serious health condition or, if the Elected Official has the serious health condition, a statement that he or she is unable due to the health condition to perform the essential functions of the position or work of any kind.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(2)">(2)</span> The Tribal Governing Board, if it doubts the certification, at its expense, may require an Elected Official seeking leave due to a serious medical condition to obtain a second opinion from a doctor or other health care professional designated by the Tribal Governing Board. If the second opinion conflicts with the certification provided by the Elected Official, the Tribal Governing Board may, at its sole discretion and at its expense, require a third opinion from a doctor or other health care professional designated jointly by the Tribal Governing Board and the Elected Official. Such a third opinion will be final and binding.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(3)">(3)</span> If an Elected Official plans to take intermittent leave or work a reduced schedule, the certification must also include dates and the duration of treatment and a statement of medical necessity for taking intermittent leave or working a reduced schedule. During a leave taken under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/lco/council/code/MCCchapter/MCC.1/subchapter/MCC.1.6/section/MCC.1.6.190" title="MCC.1.6.190 Family And Medical Leave">Section MCC.1.6.190</a>, Elected Official may be required to provide, periodically, written notice to the Tribal Governing Board concerning his or her status and intention to return to work.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(i)">(i)</span> <u>Return from Leave</u>. Upon completion of leave due to an Elected Official's own serious health condition, the Elected Official must provide the Tribal Governing Board with medical certification from his or her doctor or other health care professional that the Elected Official is now able to return to work. If an Elected Official fails to provide this certification, he or she will not be permitted to return to work until such certification is provided. The Tribal Governing Board may choose to exempt an Elected Official from this requirement and remove them from office pursuant to Article III, Â§ 7 of the Amended Constitution and Bylaws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(j)">(j)</span> <u>Health Benefits during Leave</u>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(1)">(1)</span> During a leave taken pursuant to this ordinance, an Elected Official's health benefits under any existing Tribal sponsored health plan will be continued as if the Elected Official had continued his/her duties in office continuously for the duration of the leave. If, however, an Elected Official fails to return at the end of a leave taken under this policy, except if this is due to the continuation, recurrence or onset of a serious health condition or something else beyond the Elected Official's control, then the Tribal Governing Board may recover from the Elected Official all of the health care premiums paid to maintain health coverage during the leave.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(2)">(2)</span> If under the Tribe's current policy, an Elected Official pays a portion of the health care premium, while on paid leave, the Tribe will continue to make payroll deductions to collect the Elected Official's share of the premium. While on unpaid leave, the Elected Official must continue to make this payment, either in person or by mail. The payment must be received by the first day of each month. If the payment is more than thirty (30) days late, the Elected Official's health care coverage may be dropped for the duration of the leave.</p>
