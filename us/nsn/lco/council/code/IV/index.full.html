                <p>This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the inherent sovereign authority of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians to determine its Tribal citizenship which predates its Treaties of 1825, 1826, 1837, 1842, 1847 and 1854 with the United States Government. In the implementation of this inherent sovereign authority, Article II, §§ 2, 3 and 4 of the Amended Constitution and By-laws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians empowers the Tribal Governing Board to enact an ordinance pertaining to citizenship. A critical component of the implementation of the Citizenship Code is the establishment of the Citizenship Committee. The responsibility of the Citizenship Committee is to review applications for Tribal citizenship, accept relinquishment requests, accept requests to rescind relinquishment, and recommend the acceptance or rejection of Citizenship applications or renunciation petitions to the Tribal Governing Board.</p>

In the implementation of this inherent sovereign authority, Article II, §§ 2, 3 and 4 of the Amended Constitution and By-laws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians empowers the tribal governing board to "enact the ordinance subject to approval of the Secretary of the Interior stating the criteria for future membership and adoption of the new members…," establish that "Any person who has been rejected for enrollment as a member of the Band shall have the right of appeal to the Secretary of the Interior, whose decision shall be final" and "enact ordinances governing loss of membership..." The authority of the Citizenship Committee is derived from Subchapter 1.3 of Title IV, Chapter 1 of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians Tribal Code of Law (LCOTCL), which was enacted by Lac Courte Oreilles Tribal Governing Board Resolution No. 04-20 and approved by the Secretary of the Interior on October 13, 2004.</p>
