                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(1)">(1)</span> <u>Appeal Policy</u>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(1)(a)">(a)</span> It is the policy of the LCOHA to ensure fair and equitable treatment for all LCOHA employees. Therefore, all LCOHA employees have the right to appeal any suspension or termination received by an employee pursuant to § 4.1202 of this manual.  Verbal and written warnings are corrective action tools and thus are not subject to appeal.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(1)(b)">(b)</span> An employee who presents an appeal under the provisions of this manual will not be discriminated against or otherwise penalized for such action. If an employee is threatened or harassed at any time during the appeal process, he or she may notify the Human Resources Director in writing. The Human Resource Director will investigate, with the assistance of the Legal Department, such complaints and recommend proper action to the Executive Director. An appeal and any materials submitted in connection shall be considered confidential until the appeal process has been completed under the provisions of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(2)">(2)</span> <u>Appeal Procedures</u>. A formal appeal will be filed and processed in the manner described below, except that time limits may be waived or extended by written mutual consent of the parties involved.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(2)(a)">(a)</span> <u>Appeal</u>. The Employee will submit a written statement detailing the issue being appealed within three (3) working days of receiving a suspension or termination pursuant to § 4.1202 of this manual. An Employee's failure to file an appeal within the specified time period will be considered a waiver of the formal appeal procedure and the disciplinary action will be final. The Human Resources Office will make four (4) written copies of the appeal; one copy will be given to his or her supervisor, one copy will be given to the Executive Director, one copy shall be retained by the Human Resource Director, and one copy shall be placed in the Employee's file. The original copy of the appeal will always remain with the Human Resources Office.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(2)(b)">(b)</span> If at any time during the process the Employee and the Employee's Supervisor are able to agree on a solution to the appeal filed, they may submit a joint statement outlining the acceptable terms to the Executive Director. If the terms are approved by the Executive Director, then the matter is settled with copies provided to the Employee and the Supervisor with a copy retained by the Human Resource Director. The Executive Director decision will be final.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(2)(c)">(c)</span> Once the Employee, the Supervisor, the Executive Director, and the Human Resource Department have copies of the appeal, the LCOHA Human Resource Director shall provide a copy of the appeal to the Tribal Operations Human Resource Director and the process shall continue pursuant to subsection (3) below.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(a)(ii)">(ii)</span> The Tribal Operations Human Resource Director, or designee, will notify the employee and the LCOHA Human Resource Director of the evidentiary hearing date by personal delivery or certified mail at least five (5) days prior to the scheduled hearing date.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(a)(iii)">(iii)</span> The employee is limited to one (1) advocate, at his or her cost, and no more than five (5) witnesses.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(a)(iv)">(iv)</span> All employees requested to testify at an appeal, must attend the appeal hearing when directed by the Tribal Operations Human Resource Director, or designee. Failure to appear may result in a monetary fine or disciplinary action or both.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(b)(iii)">(iii)</span> The appeals committee shall determine whether the employee committed the policy violation(s) upon which the discipline is based and whether the employer followed the appropriate procedural steps established in § 4.1202 of this manual. The employer has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence whether each violation occurred and whether the appropriate procedural steps established in § 4.1202 of this manual were followed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(b)(iv)">(iv)</span> If the appeals committee determines that the employer failed to meet the burden of proof regarding all violations and procedural steps established in § 4.1202 of this manual, it shall overturn the decision of the employer and order that the employee's personnel file reflect such decision; that the employee be restored to his or her previous position and that all the benefits which may have been withheld shall be credited to the employee as if no disciplinary action had ever occurred. Upon return to work, the LCOHA Human Resource Director will meet with the employee and the department head or director and development a work reinstatement plan including specific timelines and tasks for reintroduction into the workforce.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(b)(v)">(v)</span> If the appeals committee determines that the employer met the burden of proof regarding only a portion, but not all of the violations, it shall overturn the decision of the employer only regarding such violations and may, but is not required to, order such adjustments as it deems proper, including that the employee's personnel file reflect such decision; that the employee shall be restored to his or her previous position and - that all or a portion of the benefits which may have been withheld shall be credited to the employee as if no disciplinary action had ever occurred.

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(b)(vi)">(vi)</span> If the appeals committee determines that the employer met the burden of proof regarding all violations and the appropriate procedural steps established in § 4.1202 of this manual were followed, it shall uphold the decision of the employer; and shall uphold all disciplinary measures taken without substituting its judgment for that of the employer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(b)(vii)">(vii)</span> The appeals committee shall issue a written decision within ten (10) working days which includes for each alleged claim or violation, both findings of fact and a conclusion regarding each claim or work rule violation. The decision shall be provided to each party.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(b)(viii)">(viii)</span> If either party disagrees with the appeals committee's decision, the party may appeal the decision to the Tribal Court by filing notice of appeal within three (3) working days of the decision, with a copy to the Tribal Operations Human Resource Director. The filing of an appeal by the employer shall stay any action under subsection (4) (b) (iv) or (v) above, pending resolution of the appeal by the Tribal Court.

The Lac Courte Oreilles Legal Department shall be notified of all appeals and shall be provided with the entire record of the grievance and the all information submitted in connection to the appeal.</p>

If the Court finds any deficiencies in the Appeals Committee's decision, it shall remand the matter back the Appeal Committee for further review consistent with the Court's findings. Each party shall have five (5) working days to submit their request for Tribal Court review of the Appeals Committee's decision; failure to abide the timeline stated in this section shall be deemed a waiver of the disciplinary appeal and the appeal shall be terminated; the Appeals Committee's decision shall be deemed as final.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(c)(i)">(i)</span> The Tribal Court shall have the discretion to decide whether to schedule a hearing in any employment appeal.</p>
