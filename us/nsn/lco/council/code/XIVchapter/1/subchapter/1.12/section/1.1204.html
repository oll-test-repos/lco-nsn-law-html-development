                <p>1) The Tribal Court is required to defer to interpretations of this ordinance as made by the Tribe [pursuant to the Chevron Doctrine], unless such interpretations are unreasonable.  An action determined to be unreasonable shall be established by clear and convincing evidence.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(b)(iv)">(iv)</span> If the Tribal Court determines that the employer had a reasonable basis to believe that it met the burden of proof regarding any of the violations and the appropriate procedural steps established in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/lco/council/code/XIVchapter/1/subchapter/1.12/section/1.1202" title="1.1202 Grounds For Disciplinary Action">§ 1.1202</a> of this manual were followed, it shall uphold the decision of the employer; and shall uphold all disciplinary measures taken without substituting its judgment for that of the employer.</p>

                <p>1) Any award of back wages or other benefits that may have been withheld from the employee shall be limited to ninety (90) days;</p>
                <p>2) No attorney's fees may be awarded as established in 2 LCOTCL § 1.1106.</p>

                <p>4) The employee has a duty to mitigate any award of back wages by attempting to retain other employment. In order to provide proof of mitigation, the employee must provide evidence to the Tribal Court that the employee has applied for at least one (1) equivalent positions per week.</p>
                <p>5) The employee is not guaranteed restoration to his or her previous position. Such reinstatement shall occur at the discretion of the Tribe.

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(b)(vi)">(vi)</span> The Tribal Court may issue its decision orally immediately. In all cases it shall issue a written decision within forty-five (45) days as established by 2 LCOTCL § 1.1104 and shall provide the parties with notice thereof. If the Tribal Court does not issue a written decision within forty-five (45) days, it is presumed that the Tribal Court has determined that the employer had a reasonable basis to believe that it met the burden of proof and as a result the action of the employer shall be upheld. The written decision shall include findings of fact, a conclusion regarding each violation, and any money judgments as conditioned in subsection (3) (b) (v), above. The decision shall be provided to each party by first-class mail to the person's last known address; electronic mail to the party and to the party's attorney or lay advocate who has filed a notice of appearance in the action; or by delivery to such person, the person's home, or the person's office.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(b)(vii)">(vii)</span> If either party disagrees with the decision of the Tribal Court, that party may appeal the decision to the Court of Appeals by filing a notice of appeal within ten (10) working days of the party's receipt of the decision pursuant to subsection (3) (b) (vi) above. The filing of an appeal by the employer shall stay any action under subsection (3) (b) (v) above, pending resolution of the appeal by the Court of Appeals. Failure to abide by the timeline stated in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/lco/council/code/XIVchapter/1/subchapter/1.12/section/1.1204" title="1.1204 Disciplinary Action Appeal Procedure">this section</a> shall be deemed a waiver of the disciplinary appeal and the Tribal Court's decision shall be deemed as final. A Clerk of Court shall submit to the Court of Appeals the record of the employment appeal hearing within five (5) working days of receiving a copy of the notice of appeal. The Lac Courte Oreilles Office of the Attorney General shall be notified of all appeals of a Tribal Court decision pursuant to the methods established in subsection (3) (b) (vi) above.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(c)">(c)</span> <u>Court of Appeals Hearings</u>. Either party may request a review of the Tribal Court's decision by the Lac Courte Oreilles Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals review will be limited to the information presented to the Tribal Court and the limited review is to determine whether the Tribal Court committed a clear error. If the Court of Appeals finds any clear errors in the decision of the Tribal Court, it shall overturn the decision and may remand the matter back the Tribal Court for further review consistent with the Court of Appeals findings.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(c)(i)">(i)</span> The Court of Appeals shall have the discretion to decide whether to schedule an oral argument pertaining to an employment appeal.</p>
