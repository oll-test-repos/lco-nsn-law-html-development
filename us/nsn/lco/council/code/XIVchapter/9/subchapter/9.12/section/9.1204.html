                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(1)">(1)</span> <u>Appeal Policy</u>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(1)(a)">(a)</span> It is the policy of the Gaming Enterprises to ensure fair and equitable treatment for all team members. Therefore, the Tribe on behalf of the Gaming Enterprises hereby issues a waiver of its sovereign immunity pursuant to 2 LCOTCL § 5.302 to all non-contracted employees for the limited purpose of appealing in Tribal Court as detailed in this section, any suspension or termination received by a team member pursuant to § 9.1202 of this manual, however the right to appeal does not extend to probationary actions pursuant to § 9.414; and the right to appeal does not extend to discipline received for engaging in dishonest acts pursuant to § 9.805 (2)(n). Verbal and written warnings are corrective action tools and thus are not subject to appeal pursuant to § 9.1203(a)(i) and § 9.1203 (b)(i).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(1)(b)">(b)</span> Any additional claims asserted by an employee against the Gaming Enterprises or the Tribe, must be filled pursuant to 2 LCOTCL § 1.901. The Tribe on its own behalf, as well as on behalf of the Gaming Enterprises, has not waived its sovereign immunity with regard to any claims filed pursuant to 2 LCOTCL § 1.901.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(2)">(2)</span> <u>Appeal Procedures</u>. A formal appeal will be filed and processed in the manner described below, except that time limits may be waived or extended by written mutual consent of the parties involved.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(2)(a)">(a)</span> <u>Appeal</u>. The team member will submit a written statement detailing the issue being appealed within three (3) working days of receiving a suspension or termination pursuant to § 9.511 and § 9.1202 of this manual to the Human Resource Office. A team member's failure to file an appeal within the specified time period will be considered a waiver of the formal appeal procedure and the disciplinary action will be final.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(2)(b)">(b)</span> If at any time during the process the team member and the team member's Director/Manager are able to agree on a solution to the appeal filed, they may submit a joint statement outlining the acceptable terms to the Executive Management Team. If the terms are approved by the Executive Management Team, then the matter is settled with copies provided to the team member and the Director/Manager with a copy retained by the Human Resource Director. The Executive Management Team decision will be final.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(3)">(3)</span> <u>Hearings</u>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(a)">(a)</span> <u>Schedule of Hearings</u>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(a)(i)">(i)</span> Upon timely receipt of all appeal documentation, the Human Resource Director, or designee, will file the employment appeal with the Tribal Court and request an initial hearing. The original copy of the appeal shall remain with the Human Resources Office.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(a)(ii)">(ii)</span> The Tribal Court shall serve upon the employee, the notice of the employment appeal hearing date along with a copy of the employment appeal filings by personal delivery or certified mail at least five (5) days prior to the scheduled hearing date.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(a)(iii)">(iii)</span> The Lac Courte Oreilles Office of the Attorney General shall be notified of all appeals by the Tribal Court in the same manner as provided in subsection (3) (a) (ii), above. The Human Resource Director, or designee, shall provide the Lac Courte Oreilles Office of the Attorney General with the entire record of the grievance and all information submitted in connection to the appeal.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(a)(iv)">(iv)</span> All employees requested to testify at an employment appeal hearing, must attend the hearing when directed by the Human Resource Director, or designee. Failure to appear may result in a monetary fine or disciplinary action or both. The Gaming Enterprises recognizes that some employees possess official immunity and may not be compelled to testify.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(b)">(b)</span> <u>Tribal Court Hearings</u>. The Tribal Court will conduct an employment appeal hearing pursuant to the provisions of this section. Any reliance by the Tribal Court upon the provisions of Title II, Chapter 1 of the LCOTCL – Court and Civil Procedure Code shall be secondary to the provisions of this ordinance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(b)(i)">(i)</span> The Tribal Court shall schedule an initial appearance within thirty (30) days of the filing, at which time the Gaming Enterprises shall enter its initial plea, the Tribal Court shall set forth a scheduling order pursuant to 2 LCOTCL § 1.905 and shall schedule a trial date pursuant to 2 LCOTCL § 1.1001. The initial trial date shall be scheduled within sixty (60) days of the filing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(b)(ii)">(ii)</span> the Trial shall be conducted pursuant to 2 LCOTCL – Subchapter 1.10.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(b)(iii)">(iii)</span> The Tribal Court shall determine, by a preponderance of the evidence, whether the Gaming Enterprises reasonably believed that the team member committed the policy violation(s) upon which the discipline is based and whether the Gaming Enterprises followed the appropriate procedural steps established in § 9.1202 of this manual.</p>
                <p>1) The Tribal Court is required to defer to interpretations of this ordinance as made by the Gaming Enterprises [pursuant to the Chevron Doctrine], unless such interpretations are unreasonable.  An action determined to be unreasonable shall be established by clear and convincing evidence.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(b)(iv)">(iv)</span> If the Tribal Court determines that the Gaming Enterprises had a reasonable basis to believe that it met the burden of proof regarding any of the violations and the appropriate procedural steps established in § 9.1202 of this manual were followed, it shall uphold the decision of the Gaming Enterprises; and shall uphold all disciplinary measures taken without substituting its judgment for that of the Gaming Enterprises.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(b)(v)">(v)</span> If the Tribal Court determines that the Gaming Enterprises did not have a reasonable basis to believe that it met the burden of proof regarding any of the violations and procedural steps established in § 9.1202 of this manual, it shall overturn the decision of the employer and order that the employee's personnel file reflect such decision conditioned on the following:</p>
                <p>1) Any award of back wages or other benefits that may have been withheld from the employee shall be limited to ninety (90) days;</p>
                <p>2) No attorney's fees may be awarded as established in 2 LCOTCL § 1.1106.</p>
                <p>3) Any award of back wages shall be reduced by all amounts earned through other employment or unemployment insurance during the time between the employee's separation and the conclusion of this action;</p>
                <p>4) The employee has a duty to mitigate any award of back wages by attempting to retain other employment. In order to provide proof of mitigation, the employee must provide evidence to the Tribal Court that the employee has applied for at least one (1) equivalent positions per week.</p>
                <p>5) The employee is not guaranteed restoration to his or her previous position. Such reinstatement shall occur at the discretion of the Gaming Enterprises. If the Gaming Enterprises restores the employee to his or her previous position, the Human Resource Director shall meet with the employee and the department head or director and develop a work reinstatement plan including specific timelines and tasks for reintroduction into the workforce.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(b)(vi)">(vi)</span> The Tribal Court may issue its decision orally immediately. In all cases it shall issue a written decision within forty-five (45) days as established by 2 LCOTCL § 1.1104 and shall provide the parties with notice thereof. If the Tribal Court does not issue a written decision within forty-five (45) days, it is presumed that the Tribal Court has determined that the employer had a reasonable basis to believe that it met the burden of proof and as a result the action of the employer shall be upheld. The written decision shall include findings of fact, a conclusion regarding each violation, and any money judgments as conditioned in subsection (3) (b) (v), above. The decision shall be provided to each party by first-class mail to the person's last known address; electronic mail to the party and to the party's attorney or lay advocate who has filed a notice of appearance in the action; or by delivery to such person, the person's home, or the person's office.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(b)(vii)">(vii)</span> If either party disagrees with the decision of the Tribal Court, that party may appeal the decision to the Court of Appeals by filing a notice of appeal within ten (10) working days of the party's receipt of the decision pursuant to subsection (3) (b) (vi) above. The filing of an appeal by the employer shall stay any action under subsection (3) (b) (v) above, pending resolution of the appeal by the Court of Appeals. Failure to abide by the timeline stated in this section shall be deemed a waiver of the disciplinary appeal and the Tribal Court's decision shall be deemed as final. A Clerk of Court shall submit to the Court of Appeals the record of the employment appeal hearing within five (5) working days of receiving a copy of the notice of appeal. The Lac Courte Oreilles Office of the Attorney General shall be notified of all appeals of a Tribal Court decision pursuant to the methods established in subsection (3) (b) (vi) above.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(c)">(c)</span> <u>Court of Appeals Hearings</u>. Either party may request a review of the Tribal Court's decision by the Lac Courte Oreilles Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals review will be limited to the information presented to the Tribal Court and the limited review is to determine whether the Tribal Court committed a clear error. If the Court of Appeals finds any clear errors in the decision of the Tribal Court, it shall overturn the decision and may remand the matter back the Tribal Court for further review consistent with the Court of Appeals findings.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(c)(i)">(i)</span> The Court of Appeals shall have the discretion to decide whether to schedule an oral argument in any employment appeal.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(c)(ii)">(ii)</span> The Court of Appeals may issue a decision without an oral argument after reviewing the decision of the Tribal Court and the evidence submitted during the grievance and appeal processes.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(c)(iii)">(iii)</span> In all cases, the Court of Appeals shall review the findings of fact and conclusions of law solely to determine whether the appeals committee committed clear error. "Clear error" occurs when a decision is not reasonably supported by the facts <s>or </s>law, standard of review, or evidentiary standards.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(c)(iv)">(iv)</span> If the Court of Appeals determines that the Tribal Court committed a clear error regarding any of the violations and procedural steps established in § 9.1202 of this manual, it shall overturn the decision of the Tribal Court and may remand the matter back the Tribal Court for further review consistent with the Court of Appeals findings</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(c)(v)">(v)</span> If the Court of Appeals determines that the Tribal Court did not commit a clear error(s) regarding any of the violations and the procedural steps established in § 9.1202 of this manual, it shall uphold the decision of the Tribal Court.</p>
