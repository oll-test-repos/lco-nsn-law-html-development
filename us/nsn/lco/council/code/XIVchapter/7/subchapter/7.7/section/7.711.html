                <p>The Tribe recognizes that individual employees may develop personal problems which could have negative effects on job performance. The Tribe offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for all employees, the purpose of which is to encourage the early diagnosis and treatment of personal, psychological, and medical problems. Employees are encouraged to contact the Human Resource Director, or designee, for information regarding the EAP. Employees are responsible for submission of all documents and paperwork to pay the costs incurred for services rendered in connection with the EAP. Employees may utilize their health insurance plan as coverage is available; otherwise the service will be self-pay. Employees may attend a scheduled EAP appointment with the LCO-CHC during work hours. If the EAP appointment is at another facility the employee may use permitted paid or unpaid leave for EAP absences. EAP appointments (that the employee is required to attend by the Employer) will be coordinated with the employee's supervisor so customer service does not get interrupted.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(1)">(1)</span> <u>Self-Referral</u>.  An employee may request assistance from their supervisor for personal, psychological, or medical reasons at any time during their employment. Strict confidentiality will be maintained throughout this process.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(1)(a)">(a)</span> <u>Procedure</u>: A department head or director shall provide the employee and the Human Resource Director, or designee, with written notice using the LCOCHC â Behavior Health Clinic intake form and a signed consent form to release and or share information between departments of any referral. The Human Resource Director will set up the EAP Process with the LCOCHC â Behavioral Health Director. The Behavioral Health Director will report to the Human Resource Director on the status of the referral within five (5) working days after receipt of the referral. Regardless of any EAP referral, employees must maintain an acceptable level of job performance. Documentation of completion or non-completion of the EAP will be on file in the employee's personnel file located in the Human Resource Department.</p>
