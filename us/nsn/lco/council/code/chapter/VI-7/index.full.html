                </p>
                <p>This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the inherent sovereign authority of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, to promote the health, safety, and welfare of Lac Courte Oreilles citizens (members) and protect the environment of the Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation, which predates its Treaties of 1825, 1826, 1837, 1842, 1847 and 1854 with the United States Government. In the implementation of this inherent sovereign authority, Article V, §§ 1(s) and (f) of the Amended Constitution and Bylaws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, empowers the Tribal Governing Board to: "To promulgate and enforce ordinances…providing for the maintenance of law and order and the administration of justice…" Article V, § 1 (s) and "to manage, lease, permit or otherwise deal with tribal lands, interests in lands or other assets, and to purchase lands, or interests in lands, within or without the reservation" Article V, § 1 (f). Pursuant to this inherent sovereign authority, the Tribal Governing Board hereby recognizes that uncontrolled use of the shorelands and pollution of the navigable waters of the Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation would adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of Lac Courte Oreilles citizens (members). The Lac Courte Oreilles Tribal Governing Board has the responsibility to promote the health, safety, and welfare, of Lac Courte Oreilles citizens (members); to further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions; prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control building sites, placement of structures; and to preserve shore cover and natural beauty. This ordinance has been adopted for the purpose of protecting the environment of the Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation.</p>
