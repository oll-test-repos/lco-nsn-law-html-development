                <p>It is the policy of the Lac Courte Oreilles Tribe to promote the traditional value of respect for tribal elders and vulnerable adults.  Elders, in particular, are valuable resources to the Tribe because they are repositories and custodians of tribal history, culture, and tradition and they are the best hope of the Tribe to pass on the tribal history, culture, and tradition to the children of the Tribe.  Elders also have valuable skills and knowledge as a result of their life experiences that, when shared, can offer important insights to younger generations and contribute to a healthy future for the Tribe.  Thus, it is in the best interest of and serves the welfare of the Tribe to protect tribal elders.</p>
