The Tribal Governing Board possesses the inherent sovereign authority to delegate oversight and management responsibilities to program directors for the planning and daily operations of Tribal programs and entities.

The Tribe is a sovereign nation, with inherent reserved rights recognized through federal treaties; as such the tribe exists within the geographical boundaries of the United States. Immunity from private lawsuits is one aspect of inherent tribal sovereignty. Pursuant to Title II, Chapter 5 of the LCOTCL – Sovereign Immunity Code, immunity from suit means that no private lawsuit can be maintained against the Tribe or any of its subordinate entities such as the LCO-CHC, unless the Tribe consents to the action. Nothing in this manual, including without limitation the provisions of Subchapter 5.12, constitutes a waiver of the Tribe's inherent sovereign immunity.</p>

However, the LCO-CHC looks to federal employment laws as guidelines only, and nothing in this personnel policy and procedural manual shall be construed as the LCO-CHC's consent to application of such laws. Another aspect of the Tribe's inherent sovereignty is that Wisconsin Statutes are not applicable on Tribal operations without the express written permission of the Tribal Governing Board.
