                </p>
                <p>This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the inherent sovereign authority of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians to negotiate, make and perform contracts and agreements of every description which predates its treaties of 1825, 1826, 1837, 1842, 1847, and 1854 with the United States Government. In the implementation of this inherent sovereign authority, Article V, § 1(c) of the Amended Constitution and By-laws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians empowers the Tribal Governing Board to "negotiate, make and perform contracts and agreements of every description, not inconsistent with law or with any provisions of this Constitution, with any person, association, or corporation, with any county, or with the State of Wisconsin or the United States." It is the purpose of this ordinance to: (1) Provide for the fair and equitable treatment of all persons or firms involved in purchasing by the Tribe; (2) Provide a means to assure that supplies, services, and construction are procured efficiently, effectively, and at the most favorable prices available to the Tribe; (3) Provide a means to assure competition in contracting; (4) Provide safeguards for maintaining a procurement system of quality and integrity; and (5) Provide a means to assure that Tribe's purchasing actions are in full compliance with applicable federal standards and regulations along with any applicable state and local laws.</p>

                <p>This ordinance shall govern all contracts and grants for the procurement of supplies, services, and construction entered into by the Tribe.  It shall apply to purchasing, irrespective of the source of funds, including contracts, which do not involve an obligation of funds (such as concession contracts); however, nothing in this ordinance shall prevent the Tribe from complying with the terms and conditions of any grant, contract, gift, or bequest that is otherwise consistent with law.</p>
                <p>When both federal and non-federal funds are used for a project, the work to be accomplished with the funds should be separately identified. The term "<em>procurement</em>," as used in this ordinance includes both contracts and modifications (including change orders) for construction or services, as well as purchase, lease, or rental of supplies and equipment.</p>

                <p>If any section, provision or portion of this ordinance is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected thereby. The Tribe further asserts immunity on its part and that of its agencies, employees, and/or agents from any action or damages that may occur as a result of reliance upon and conformance with this ordinance.</p>

                <p>The fundamental goal of the Tribe's procurement system is to satisfy end users in terms of cost, quality, and timeliness of the delivered product or service while complying with applicable laws, rules, and the Tribe's own policies. Further, those involved in the procurement function should exercise personal initiative and sound business judgment in providing best value product or services in meeting the tribe's needs.  Consistent with that goal, the CPO may assume that, if a specific strategy, practice, policy or product is in the best interests of the Tribe and is not addressed in this ordinance, nor prohibited by tribal law, federal law, or other directive including this procurement ordinance, the strategy, practice, policy or procedure may be a permissible exercise of authority. The CPO is advised to seek advice whenever doubts arise about an intended strategy, practice, policy or procedure.</p>

                <p>Certain information about the Tribe's procurements are normally considered public (e.g. name of the winner contractor and total contract price) and may be released to the public in accordance with this procurement ordinance as well as applicable tribal laws and regulations governing information.</p>
                <p>Other information related to procurement is often protected from disclosure (e.g., proprietary business information such as technical methods or processes, detailed pricing information, personal information, or other information).  The Tribe must exercise caution to ensure that protected information is not made public. Contracting personnel should consult the Tribe's Legal Department whenever there is any question regarding the release of information.</p>

                  <strong>INDIAN PREFERENCE GUIDELINES</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>INDIAN PREFERENCE:</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Eligibility for Indian preference shall be established in accordance with the requirements of federal law. If the Tribe or its prime contractor determines an applicant ineligible for Indian preference, the Tribe or its prime contractor shall notify the applicant in writing before contract award, or filling the position, or providing the desired training.</p>
                <p>The Tribe may restrict procurement activity to eligible Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises.</p>
                <p><strong>Restricted Solicitations.</strong>  The Tribe may provide Indian preference in procurement activities by advertising for bids or proposals from only qualified Indian organizations and Indian owned-enterprises.  Or, the Tribe may use a two-stage preference procedure.  The regulations describe the two-stage procedure as follows:</p>
                <p><strong>Stage 1.</strong> Invite or otherwise solicit Indian-owned economic enterprises to submit a statement of intent to respond to a bid announcement or request for proposals limited to Indian-owned firms.</p>
                <p><strong>Stage 2.</strong> If responses are received from more than one Indian enterprise found to be qualified, advertise for bids or proposals limited to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises.</p>
                <p>If the solicitation is restricted to qualified Indian owned economic enterprises and organizations, and two or more (or a greater number determined by the Tribe and stated in the invitation) qualified Indian owned economic enterprises or organizations submit responsive bids, award shall be made to the qualified enterprise or organization with the lowest responsive bid.  If equal low bids are received, drawing lots or similar random method shall make award, unless otherwise provided in state, tribal, or local law.  If fewer than the minimum number of qualified Indian owned economic enterprises or organizations submit responsive bids, all bids shall be rejected, and the Tribe shall cancel the solicitation.  The Tribe may accept a single bid received from a responsible bidder, subject to HUD approval for HUD projects, in unusual circumstances, such as if the Tribe determines that, based on a cost or price analysis, the bid price is fair and reasonable, or the Tribe determines that the delay of re-soliciting would subject the project to higher costs.</p>
                <p>Unrestricted Solicitations.  If the Tribe isn't able to award a contract based on the procedures described in the previous section, the Tribe shall re-advertise the contract inviting bids from non-Indians as well as Indian owned economic enterprises or organizations.</p>
                <p>The Tribe may require information from prospective contractors seeking to qualify as Indian organizations or Indian-owned economic enterprises.</p>
                <p>Complaints arising from any of the methods the Tribe utilizes to implement Indian preference shall be conducted in accordance with this ordinance.</p>
                <p>
                  <em>Award shall be made under unrestricted solicitations to the lowest responsive bid from a qualified Indian-owned economic enterprise or organization within the maximum total contract price established for the specific project or activity being solicited, if the bid is no more than 15% higher than the total bid price of the lowest responsive bid from any qualified bidder.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>If the bid from the qualified Indian-owned economic enterprise of organization is within the (15%) range of the lowest, non-Indian firm, the Indian-owned firm will be given the opportunity to meet the lowest bid price. Should the Indian-owned firm refuse to meet this lower price, the bid shall then be awarded to the responsive and responsible low bidder for the project.</em>

                  <em>Bidder # 4:	$116,000.00	Indian Firm</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>Bidder # 3, a non-Indian-owned firm, is the apparent low bidder for this project, Bidder # 2, an Indian-owned firm is within 15% (of Bidder # 3. Bidder # 2 is then provided the opportunity to meet the dollar amount of Bidder # 3's bid. If Bidder # 2 is unable to meet Bidder # 3's bid, the award shall be made to Bidder # 3, if Bidder # 2 is able to meet the lower bid, the award shall be made under this Indian Preference Policy. The Tribe must always ensure the lowest, responsive and responsible bid is made for every solicitation, under the Informal or Formal Bidding procedures of this document.</em>

                </p>
                <p>If needed, the Chief Procurement Officer or designee should request Davis Bacon wage-rates as determined by the Department of Labor at least forty-five (45) days prior to the initial solicitation for construction contracts. This determination must be provided to the bidder at the time the quote is requested. At least ten (10) days before award of the contract, the CPO or designee should confirm that the work is considered eligible for Davis-Bacon wage rates.</p>
