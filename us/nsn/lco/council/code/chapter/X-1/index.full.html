                </p>
                <p>This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the inherent sovereign authority of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians to provide policy guidance and ensure that the Tribe's public safety agencies serve the members and visitors of the Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation, which authority predates its Treaties of 1825, 1826, 1837, 1842, 1847 and 1854 with the United States Government. In the implementation of this inherent sovereign authority, Article V, §§ 1(l) and (m) of the Amended Constitution and Bylaws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, empowers the Tribal Governing Board to: "organize, charter and regulate any association or group … for the purpose of providing social or economic benefits to the members of the Band or residents of the reservation" Article V, § 1 (l);  and "delegate to subordinate boards, officers, committees or cooperative associations which are open to all members of the Band any of the foregoing powers, reserving the right to review any action taken by virtue of such delegated powers" Article V, § 1 (m). Pursuant to this inherent sovereign authority, the Tribal Governing Board hereby establishes a public body known as the Lac Courte Oreilles Public Safety Commission (hereinafter referred to as the Public Safety Commission), and enacts this ordinance which shall establish the purposes, powers and duties of the Public Safety Commission. In any suit, action or proceeding involving the validity or enforcement of or relating to any of actions of the Tribe's public safety agencies, the Public Safety Commission shall be conclusively deemed to have become established and authorized to transact business and exercise its powers upon proof of the adoption of this ordinance. A copy of this ordinance duly certified by the Secretary/Treasurer of the Tribal Governing Board shall be admissible in evidence in any suit, action or proceedings.</p>
