                <p>The Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians (hereinafter "Band" or "Tribe") in an effort to diversify the economy of the Tribe's reservation in order to improve the Tribe's economic self-sufficiency petitioned the Secretary of the Interior to issue a charter of corporation pursuant to section 17 of the Indian Reorganization Act, codified at U.S.C. § 5124. The BIA – Midwest Regional Office issued a certificate of incorporation for the Big Fish Golf Corporation (hereinafter "Big Fish Golf Corp" or "BFGC"). Big Fish Golf Corp is a legal entity wholly owned by the Tribe, but distinct and separate from the Tribe.</p>

                <p>It is the general policy of the BFGC to extend to its employees, where possible, the rights and benefits provided by employers regulated by the laws of the United States. However, the BFGC looks to federal employment laws as guidelines only, and nothing in this personnel policy and procedural manual shall be construed as the BFGC's consent to application of such laws. Another aspect of BFGC's inherent sovereignty is that Wisconsin Statutes are not applicable to the operations of the BFGC without the express written permission of the Big Fish Golf Corp.
