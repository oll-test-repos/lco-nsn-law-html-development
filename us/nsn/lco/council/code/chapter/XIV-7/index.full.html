The Tribal Governing Board possesses the inherent sovereign authority to delegate oversight and management responsibilities to program directors for the planning and daily operations of Tribal programs and entities.

                <p>The School is a public body established as a subordinate entity of the Tribe pursuant to 7 LCOTCL Chapter 7. The Tribe is a sovereign nation, with inherent reserved rights recognized through federal treaties, as such the tribe exists within the geographical boundaries of the United States. Immunity from suit means that no private lawsuit can be maintained against the Tribe or any of its subordinate entities such as the School, unless the Tribe consents to the action. Nothing in this manual, including without limitation the provisions of Subchapter 7.12, constitutes a waiver of the Tribe's inherent sovereign immunity.</p>

Another aspect of the Tribe's inherent sovereignty is that Wisconsin Statutes are not applicable on School operations without the express written permission of the Tribal Governing Board. The Tribe reserves the right to create and modify its employment laws and policies without regard to such laws or interpretations thereof.</p>

Time spent in such a course given by the employer or under his auspices is hours worked. However, if the stenographer takes a course in bookkeeping, it may not be directly related to her job. Thus, the time she spends voluntarily in taking such a bookkeeping course, outside of regular working hours, need not be counted as working time. Where a training course is instituted for the bona fide purpose of preparing for advancement through upgrading the employee to a higher skill, and is not intended to make the employee more efficient in his present job, the training is not considered directly related to the employee's job even though the course incidentally improves his skill in doing his regular work.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="/us/nsn/lco/council/code/chapter/XIV-7/subchapter/7.13/section/7.1309#(2)(d)">(d)</span> There are some special situations where the time spent in attending lectures, training sessions and courses of instruction is not regarded as hours worked. For example, an employer may establish for the benefit of his employees a program of instruction that corresponds to courses offered by independent bona fide institutions of learning. Voluntary attendance by an employee at such courses outside of working hours would not be hours worked even if they are directly related to his job, or paid for by the employer.</p>
