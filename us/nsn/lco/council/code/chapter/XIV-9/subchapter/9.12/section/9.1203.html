A system of progressive discipline will be utilized, when appropriate, to afford team members an opportunity to correct behavior, however some personnel infractions are severe enough to impose any of the below-mentioned disciplinary actions, up to and including termination. Disciplinary actions may be handled in any manner deemed appropriate by the Gaming Enterprises. This may include, but is not limited to, the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(1)(a)">(a)</span> <u>Verbal Counseling</u>. If a team member is not meeting the employer's standards of conduct or performance, the team member's supervisor should take the following action:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(1)(a)(i)">(i)</span> A team member may receive a verbal warning from their Director/Manager to rectify behavior which requires disciplinary action.  A verbal warning is not appealable pursuant to § 9.1204 of this manual.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(1)(a)(ii)">(ii)</span> The Director/Manager will discuss with the team member the seriousness of the problem and the possible consequences of a failure to correct the problem.

This information will be included in the team member's personnel file.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(1)(c)">(c)</span> <u>Suspension</u>. If there are additional occurrences the supervisor should take the following action, depending on the severity of the conduct:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(1)(c)(i)">(i)</span> A team member may be recommended for suspension by their Director/Manager when the team member's behavior warrants such disciplinary action.
