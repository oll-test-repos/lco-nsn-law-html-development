                <p>The Gaming Enterprises are a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Tribe established pursuant to Title XII, Chapter 1 of the LCOTCL – Gaming Code. The Tribe is a sovereign nation, with inherent reserved rights recognized through federal treaties; as such the tribe exists within the geographical boundaries of the United States. Immunity from private lawsuits is one aspect of inherent tribal sovereignty. Pursuant to Title II, Chapter 5 of the LCOTCL – Sovereign Immunity Code, immunity from suit means that no private lawsuit can be maintained against the Tribe or any of its subordinate entities such as the Gaming Enterprises, unless the Tribe consents to the action. Nothing in this manual, including without limitation the provisions of Subchapter 9.12, constitutes a waiver of the Tribe's inherent sovereign immunity.</p>

                <p>It is the general policy of the Gaming Enterprises to extend to its employees, where possible, the rights and benefits provided by employers regulated by the laws of the United States. However, the Gaming Enterprises looks to federal employment laws as guidelines only, and nothing in this personnel policy and procedural manual shall be construed as the Gaming Enterprises' consent to application of such laws. Another aspect of the Tribe's inherent sovereignty is that Wisconsin Statutes are not applicable on Tribal operations without the express written permission of the Tribal Governing Board. The Tribe reserves the right to create and modify its employment laws and policies without regard to such laws or interpretations thereof.</p>

For example, an assault committed while subject to the effects of alcohol, illegal drugs, or abused prescribed medication will subject the team member to disciplinary action, up to and including termination, because of the misconduct.</p>
