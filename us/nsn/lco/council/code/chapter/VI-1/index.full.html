                  <strong>Preamble</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Hunting, fishing and gathering has always been central to the Ojibwe way of life. As such, it is important that this ordinance fulfills two equally important goals. First, it must preserve <em>gidizhitwaawininaan</em> (our traditions and customs). Second, it must regulate the modern realities of hunting, fishing and gathering that our ancestors did not have to contemplate, such as ensuring Tribal members' safety from gunfire in residential areas. In order to ensure that this ordinance is interpreted in the spirit of <em>gidizhitwaawininaan</em>, statements of tradition and custom are placed throughout this ordinance. It is hoped that these statements will help to both preserve our past and provide guidance and education for our future.</p>

                  <strong>Tradition and Custom</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Hunting provided the means for our ancestors' survival. The meat provided us with food, the bones with tools, and the hides with clothing.</p>
                <p>But hunting is more than just a functional activity for the Ojibwe people; it is a way of life, which is marked by great respect and appreciation for all life.</p>
                <p>Our stories illustrate our values surrounding hunting. Included here are two stories.</p>
                <p>First is the story of Mother Earth's fall to Earth and how the animals saved her and taught her to respect them.</p>
                <p>Second is the story of the first Indian man and woman and how we chose hunting for our way of life.</p>
                <p>When the Morning Star asked Mother Earth to be his wife and live with him in the sky world, he cautioned her that she must follow one rule: she must never look down on the earth.</p>
                <p>If she did, she would become homesick and have to be returned to earth. Mother Earth promised to not look at the earth and went to live with Morning Star, the Sun and the Moon in their rainbow wigwam in the sky world.</p>
                <p>When they got to the sky world, Morning Star covered the doorway to the earth with a large stone and plants around the doorway to help Mother Earth keep her promise to him.</p>
                <p>One day, when Mother Earth was left alone in the sky world, she got her digging stick and went to look for food. She wandered to where the doorway to the earth was and began to gather plants. Mother Earth was not careful in her digging though and dug up so many plants that she saw through to the earth.</p>
                <p>As Morning Star warned, she became homesick and began to cry. The Sun, Moon and Morning Star heard her cries and rushed to her, as they loved her. When Morning Star discovered what had happened, he said: "Even though I love you and you are carrying my child, I must drop you back to Earth." And so he did.</p>
                <p>As Mother Earth fell through the sky down to earth, she yelled and cried in fear for she knew she could not survive. The swans and geese on earth heard her cries and flew to her in the sky.</p>
                <p>Mother Earth landed softly on their back, and they took her safely down to earth.</p>
                <p>When Mother Earth landed, the deer came to her and said: "The Great Spirit said one day that there would be Indian people, and we were to give our lives to them. In return, you must have a feast to give thanks when you take our life to thank the Great Spirit for creating us and the deer spirit for giving his life up for you. You must never waste meat or take more than you need.</p>
                <p>If you do these things, you will have good luck and all the Indian people will benefit, as you will have meat in abundance." This is how the rules of hunting were first established for the Indian people.</p>
                <p>When the Great Spirit created the first Indian man from the ribs of the first Indian woman, the deer and bear spirits were present. They placed next to the man a pipe, tobacco and a bow and arrow.</p>
                <p>The Great Spirit then took a miigis shell and blew the breath of life into the Indian man and woman. Before the Indian man and woman awoke, the Great Spirit, the Bear Spirit and the Deer Spirit hid, so as to not frighten the Indian man and woman.</p>
                <p>When the man awoke, he took the bow and arrow, tested it, and he liked it. The Great Spirit spoke into the man's mind: "Because you picked up the bow and arrow; that is the life style that you have chosen." This is why our hunting and fishing rights could not be traded away in treaties; they are god given rights.</p>

                <p>It is the policy of the Tribal Governing Board to allow members to bid exclusively on timber sales involving approximately 250 acres of trust land.  Since the adoption of this policy, members have raised concerns about the potential of abuse of this benefit if a member bid on a sale in name only and if awarded, would not be significantly involved in other aspects of the timber sale.</p>
                <p>The purpose of this ordinance is to deter and eliminate members from bidding on sales in name only.  It is in the best interest of members to be directly involved in timber sales so that they benefit the most financially from timber sales.</p>
                <p>MEMBERS FRONTING FOR NON-INDIAN PERSONS OR COMPANIES OR NON-LCO TRIBAL MEMBERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING A TIMBER SALE CONTRACT WILL NOT BE TOLERATED.  THE LCO TRIBAL MEMBER MUST HAVE SUBSTANTIAL CONTROL OF THE OPERATION.</p>
                <p>This ordinance supersedes, rescinds and takes precedence over any and all previous Timber Harvesting Policies that address member timber sales which may have been adopted by tribal entities, agencies, committees or by the Tribal Governing Board.</p>
                <p>This ordinance shall remain in effect until reviewed and/or revised at the discretion of the Tribal Governing Board.</p>
