The report shall specify how the disposition is related to the circumstances leading to the petition and the role each affected person is expected to play in the removal of such circumstances in the future.  Any other party may submit such a report.  All such reports shall be filed with the Children's Court no later than four (4) days prior to the dispositional hearing, unless all parties waive such time limit.  The clerk shall provide copies to the child's guardian ad litem (if any) and counsel for any party, or directly to any party not represented by counsel, together with a notice requiring the recipient to bring the copy of the report to the dispositional hearing, and prohibiting the recipient from copying or allowing any copies of the report to be made.
