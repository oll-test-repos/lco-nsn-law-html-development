The initial cost for this testing will be incurred by the Tribe.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(1)(b)">(b)</span> The laboratory evaluation of the samples will be carried out by a laboratory that is contracted with the LCO-CHC and is certified by either the College of American Pathologists or the National Institute on Drug Abuse.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(1)(c)">(c)</span> In the event of a positive test result, a confirmation test will be performed by a laboratory specified in subs.
