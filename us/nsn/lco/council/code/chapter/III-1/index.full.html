                </p>
                <p>This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the inherent sovereign authority of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians relating to the operation of the Tribal Government and the delivery of governmental services, which predates its Treaties of 1825, 1826, 1837, 1842, 1847 and 1854 with the United States Government. In the implementation of this inherent sovereign authority, Articles III and V of the Amended Constitution and Bylaws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, empowers the Tribal Governing Board to: "determine its own procedures" Article III, § 6; and "to regulate, by enactment of ordinances, the conduct of business within the territory of the Band," Article V, § 1 (n). As leaders of the Odaawa-Zaaga'iganing Nation, the Tribal Governing Board will represent the citizens (members) by acknowledging the traditional and cultural values of Wisdom, Love, Respect, Bravery, Honesty, Humility, and Truth. The Tribal Governing Board shall exhibit the highest level of integrity and fairness while representing the needs of the entire Tribe. The Tribal Governing Board shall provide effective leadership while being held accountable to make fair and informed decisions. The Tribal Governing Board shall strengthen government-to-government by enacting legislation further protecting Tribal Sovereignty. This ordinance sets forth standards by which Elected Officials will conduct themselves in order to protect and promote Tribal integrity and to enhance the ability of the Tribe to achieve its objectives in a manner consistent with all applicable laws and regulations. This ordinance is also intended to guide and direct all Elected Officials in dealing with situations they may encounter while in office thereby assisting Elected Officials in making the right choices when confronted with difficult decisions.</p>

                <p>This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the inherent sovereign authority of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians relating to the operation of the Tribal Government and the delivery of governmental services which predates its Treaties of 1825, 1826, 1837, 1842, 1847 and 1854 with the United States Government. In the implementation of this inherent sovereign authority, Articles III and V of the Amended Constitution and Bylaws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, empowers the Tribal Governing Board to: "determine its own procedures" Article III, § 6; and "to regulate, by enactment of ordinances, the conduct of business within the territory of the Band," Article V, § 1 (n). The Lac Courte Oreilles Tribal Government is founded on the consent of the governed. The citizens of the Tribe are entitled to have complete confidence in the loyalty and integrity of their Elected Officials. To that end this ordinance establishes clear standards of ethical conduct and behavior of the Elected Officials to the Tribal Governing Board. This ordinance seeks to require accountability to the citizens of the Tribe by the Tribal Governing Board in exercising the authority vested with them. It is the intention of the Tribal Governing Board that the provisions of this ordinance be construed and applied in each instance, so as to accomplish its purpose in protecting the Tribe's citizens from government decisions and actions resulting from, or affected by, undue influence or conflict of interest.</p>
