In the implementation of this inherent sovereign authority, Article IV, § 3 of the Amended Constitution and By-laws of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians empowers the tribal governing board to "prescribe rules and regulations conducting all subsequent elections." The Tribal Governing Board duly enacted the Election Code on April 29, 2005 pursuant to Tribal Governing Board Resolution No. 05-29; as amended on May 16, 2005 pursuant to Tribal Governing Board Resolution No. 05-50; as amended on May 29, 2007 pursuant to Tribal Governing Board Resolution No. 07-59; as amended on March 11, 2011 by the Tribal Governing Board at the Lac Courte Oreilles Tribal General Membership Meeting; and as amended on May 27, 2015 pursuant to Tribal Governing Board Resolution No. 15-53.</p>
