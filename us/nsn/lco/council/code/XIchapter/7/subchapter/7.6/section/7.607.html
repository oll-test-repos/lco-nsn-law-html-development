Any written response shall state any defenses or factual disputes and where any defendant appears in person, a written response shall be served upon the plaintiff within five (5) calendar days of any hearing, excluding weekends and holidays.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(b)">(b)</span> The Court shall set a hearing date which is no more than fifteen (15) calendar days following the date for appearance, except when the hearing date would fall on a weekend or holiday, and in such a situation on the first regular Court day following that date.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(c)">(c)</span> A defendant may, for good cause shown, and upon the payment of a reasonable sum for the fair rental value of the dwelling between the date on which the complaint was filed and the date of hearing, obtain an extension of time, beyond the fifteen (15) day period.

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(4)(b)">(b)</span> The Housing Authority has failed or refused to make repairs which are his responsibility after a reasonable demand by a tenant to do so, without good cause, and the repairs are necessary for the reasonable enjoyment of the dwelling.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(4)(h)">(h)</span> Any other material or relevant fact the tenant might present that may explain why his eviction is unjust and unfair.</p>
