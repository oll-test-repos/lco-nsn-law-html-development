                <p>It is the responsibility of the Casino to make our best effort to keep our patrons and team members safe from harm or harassment. While Banishment is generally applied to Guests, at times Team Members may be banished for a fixed time, suspended, and/or leading up to termination.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Banishment authority is provided to the Manager on Duty at the time of the incident of violation in accordance with this policy. If there is a challenge to this decision by the patron or Team Member, all available evidence of the incident is to be reviewed by a member of Executive Management team and their decision will be a final disposition of the matter.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Criteria for Banishment.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> <u>Panhandling</u>. Unwarranted or unwelcome requests for borrowing or begging of money, items or services from another person for any reason is considered a form of harassment and will not be permitted on casino property at any time. The perpetrator will be given verbal &amp; written notification (documented and retained on file by patron name by the Manager on Duty) of the offense and informed that further incidents carry ban consequences up to and including a permanent ban from both properties:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(A)">(A)</span> 1st offense, Verbal Warning	90-day ban</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(B)">(B)</span> 2nd offense, Written Warning	1-year ban</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(C)">(C)</span> 3rd offense, Final Written 	3-year ban*</p>
                <p>*Upon completion of the 3 year ban, the offender must request a meeting with the Executive Staff to discuss possible reinstatement.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> <u>Underage Drinking</u>. Any person under 21 years of age observed consuming alcohol on the premises shall be banned until they are the legal minimum age of 21. Such a person shall be informed that if a 2nd offense occurs, management will contact law enforcement immediately, which may result in them being detained for the local authorities to do a sobriety test. Such a person shall also be notified that a 3rd offense shall result in a permanent ban from both properties:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(A)">(A)</span> 1st offense, banned from the bar and casino until minimum drinking age of 21</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(B)">(B)</span> 2nd offense, banned from the bar and casino until the minimum drinking age of 21 and detained for local authorities</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(C)">(C)</span> 3rd offense, 3-year ban*</p>
                <p>* Upon completion of the 3 year ban, the offender must request a meeting with the Executive Staff to discuss possible reinstatement.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)">(3)</span> <u>Intoxication</u>. All patrons that are visibly intoxicated will not be allowed to consume alcohol or gamble. If the intoxicated patron is disruptive, behaving offensively or is projecting a negative image, that patron will be asked to leave immediately. When an intoxicated patron has been asked to leave the premises, Security and the Manager on Duty will assist the patron in acquiring alternative transportation to their destination, whether it is finding a friend or relative the patron came with, calling someone for this person, or calling a cab if the patron has cab fare. When all other attempts fail, local law enforcement may need to be called. The perpetrator of the offense will be given a verbal &amp; written notification and be informed that further incidents carry ban consequences up to and including a permanent ban from both properties. Any further incidents shall result in:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)(A)">(A)</span> 1st offense, Verbal Warning	90-day ban</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)(C)">(C)</span> 3rd offense, Final Written	3-year ban*</p>
                <p>* Upon completion of the 3 year ban, the offender must request a meeting with the Executive Staff to discuss possible reinstatement.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(4)">(4)</span> <u>Verbal Confrontation or Threats</u>. Verbal confrontations or threats to other patrons or team members are taken very seriously. These are seen as offensive to other patrons, damaging to the Lac Courte Oreilles Band's public image and detrimental to the friendly and hospitable environment management desires to create for our guests. The perpetrator will be sent a written letter (documented and retained on file by patron name by the Manager on Duty) with date of incident, time of banishment period and a warning that future incidents carry consequences up to and including a permanent ban from both properties.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(4)(A)">(A)</span> 1st offense, Verbal Warning	90-day ban</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(4)(C)">(C)</span> 3rd offense, Final Written	3-year ban*</p>
                <p>* Upon completion of the 3 year ban, the offender must request a meeting with the Executive Staff to discuss possible reinstatement.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(5)">(5)</span> <u>Physical Confrontations</u>. In any incidents involving a physical confrontation with patrons or team members, local law enforcement Departments will be contacted and the patrons involved will immediately be removed from the premises by Security, or local law enforcement Department, when necessary, and placed on the appropriate ban. When required, an investigation will be done by the Manager on Duty to determine the aggressor of the altercation. In all cases, the initial aggressor will be immediately banned. Through the investigation, if it is determined that the victim has engaged beyond defending themselves or third parties engage as aggressors, multiple patrons are subject to banishment. The perpetrator(s) will be sent a written letter &amp; verbal notification (documented and retained on file by patron name by the Manager on Duty) of the offense and informed that further incidents carry ban consequences up to and including a permanent ban from both properties:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(5)(A)">(A)</span> 1st offense, Verbal Warning	90-day ban</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(5)(B)">(B)</span> 2nd offense, Written Warning	1-year ban</p>
