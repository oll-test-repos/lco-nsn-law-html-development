Pursuant to the Amended Constitution and Bylaws of the Tribe, ultimate legal and fiscal responsibility of the Tribe is with the Tribal Governing Board, as the elected representatives of the members of the Tribe. The Tribal Governing Board possesses the inherent sovereign authority to delegate oversight and management responsibilities to program directors for the planning and daily operations of Tribal programs and entities.

                <p>The Tribe is a sovereign nation, with inherent reserved rights recognized through federal treaties; as such the tribe exists within the geographical boundaries of the United States. Immunity from private lawsuits is one aspect of inherent tribal sovereignty. Immunity from suit means that no private lawsuit can be maintained against the Tribe, unless the Tribe consents to the action.

However, the Tribe looks to federal employment laws as guidelines only, and nothing in this personnel policy and procedural manual shall be construed as the Tribe's consent to application of such laws. Another aspect of the Tribe's inherent sovereignty is that Wisconsin Statutes are not applicable on Tribal operations without the express written permission of the Tribal Governing Board. The Tribe reserves the right to create and modify its employment laws and policies without regard to such laws or interpretations thereof.</p>

                <p>The Tribe recognizes that individual employees may develop personal problems which could have negative effects on job performance. The Tribe offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for all employees, the purpose of which is to encourage the early diagnosis and treatment of personal, psychological, and medical problems. Employees are encouraged to contact the Human Resource Director, or designee, for information regarding the EAP. Employees are responsible for submission of all documents and paperwork to pay the costs incurred for services rendered in connection with the EAP. Employees may utilize their health insurance plan as coverage is available; otherwise the service will be self-pay. Employees may attend a scheduled EAP appointment with the LCO-CHC during work hours. If the EAP appointment is at another facility the employee may use permitted paid or unpaid leave for EAP absences. EAP appointments (that the employee is required to attend by the Employer) will be coordinated with the employee's supervisor so customer service does not get interrupted.</p>

                <p>The fundamental goal of the Tribe's procurement system is to satisfy end users in terms of cost, quality, and timeliness of the delivered product or service while complying with applicable laws, rules, and the Tribe's own policies. Further, those involved in the procurement function should exercise personal initiative and sound business judgment in providing best value product or services in meeting the tribe's needs.  Consistent with that goal, the CPO may assume that, if a specific strategy, practice, policy or product is in the best interests of the Tribe and is not addressed in this ordinance, nor prohibited by tribal law, federal law, or other directive including this procurement ordinance, the strategy, practice, policy or procedure may be a permissible exercise of authority. The CPO is advised to seek advice whenever doubts arise about an intended strategy, practice, policy or procedure.</p>

                <p>Other information related to procurement is often protected from disclosure (e.g., proprietary business information such as technical methods or processes, detailed pricing information, personal information, or other information).

                <p><strong>Caution:</strong> Only the TGB is authorized to bind the Tribe by making an implied contract such as making a promise or stating an intent to purchase, either orally or in writing. Under the laws of the Tribe, the Tribe may be liable for, or bound by, an action of the CPO, or his/her designee only if the offeror has been given authority by the TGB. Therefore, all unapproved actions that could be misinterpreted as committing the TGB to purchase should be clarified with a statement such as, "this request for price quotation is not an offer to buy and should not be assumed as such."</p>

However, consideration should be given to storage, security, and 	handling requirements when planning these types of purchasing actions. 	For example, it may not be economical or prudent to buy truckloads of a product at deep discounts if there is no appropriate storage space for the product or if the cost of handling the product would exceed the savings price.</p>

If a significant period of time has elapsed, or the CPO knows that certain market conditions have changed, the CPO should request that an updated ICE be prepared to use in evaluating offers.</p>

If the Tribe or its prime contractor determines an applicant ineligible for Indian preference, the Tribe or its prime contractor shall notify the applicant in writing before contract award, or filling the position, or providing the desired training.</p>
                <p>The Tribe may restrict procurement activity to eligible Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises.</p>
                <p><strong>Restricted Solicitations.</strong>  The Tribe may provide Indian preference in procurement activities by advertising for bids or proposals from only qualified Indian organizations and Indian owned-enterprises.  Or, the Tribe may use a two-stage preference procedure.  The regulations describe the two-stage procedure as follows:</p>
                <p><strong>Stage 1.</strong> Invite or otherwise solicit Indian-owned economic enterprises to submit a statement of intent to respond to a bid announcement or request for proposals limited to Indian-owned firms.</p>
                <p><strong>Stage 2.</strong> If responses are received from more than one Indian enterprise found to be qualified, advertise for bids or proposals limited to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises.</p>
                <p>If the solicitation is restricted to qualified Indian owned economic enterprises and organizations, and two or more (or a greater number determined by the Tribe and stated in the invitation) qualified Indian owned economic enterprises or organizations submit responsive bids, award shall be made to the qualified enterprise or organization with the lowest responsive bid.  If equal low bids are received, drawing lots or similar random method shall make award, unless otherwise provided in state, tribal, or local law.  If fewer than the minimum number of qualified Indian owned economic enterprises or organizations submit responsive bids, all bids shall be rejected, and the Tribe shall cancel the solicitation.  The Tribe may accept a single bid received from a responsible bidder, subject to HUD approval for HUD projects, in unusual circumstances, such as if the Tribe determines that, based on a cost or price analysis, the bid price is fair and reasonable, or the Tribe determines that the delay of re-soliciting would subject the project to higher costs.</p>
                <p>Unrestricted Solicitations.  If the Tribe isn't able to award a contract based on the procedures described in the previous section, the Tribe shall re-advertise the contract inviting bids from non-Indians as well as Indian owned economic enterprises or organizations.</p>
                <p>The Tribe may require information from prospective contractors seeking to qualify as Indian organizations or Indian-owned economic enterprises.</p>
                <p>Complaints arising from any of the methods the Tribe utilizes to implement Indian preference shall be conducted in accordance with this ordinance.</p>
                <p>
                  <em>Award shall be made under unrestricted solicitations to the lowest responsive bid from a qualified Indian-owned economic enterprise or organization within the maximum total contract price established for the specific project or activity being solicited, if the bid is no more than 15% higher than the total bid price of the lowest responsive bid from any qualified bidder.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>If the bid from the qualified Indian-owned economic enterprise of organization is within the (15%) range of the lowest, non-Indian firm, the Indian-owned firm will be given the opportunity to meet the lowest bid price. Should the Indian-owned firm refuse to meet this lower price, the bid shall then be awarded to the responsive and responsible low bidder for the project.</em>

The Tribal Governing Board possesses the inherent sovereign authority to delegate oversight and management responsibilities to program directors for the planning and daily operations of Tribal programs and entities.

Employees should not expect that evaluations will automatically result in a change in pay. However, the LCOHA will rely on evaluations, in addition to all other relevant information, to make decisions about an employee's terms and conditions of employment.</p>

                <p>The Tribe recognizes that individual employees may develop personal problems which could have negative effects on job performance. The Tribe offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for all employees, the purpose of which is to encourage the early diagnosis and treatment of personal, psychological, and medical problems. Employees are encouraged to contact the Human Resource Director, or designee, for information regarding the EAP. Employees are responsible for submission of all documents and paperwork to pay the costs incurred for services rendered in connection with the EAP. Employees may utilize their health insurance plan as coverage is available; otherwise the service will be self-pay. Employees may attend a scheduled EAP appointment with the LCO-CHC during work hours. If the EAP appointment is at another facility the employee may use permitted paid or unpaid leave for EAP absences. EAP appointments (that the employee is required to attend by the Employer) will be coordinated with the employee's supervisor so customer service does not get interrupted.</p>

It is in the best interest of the LCOHA and all employees that these issues be resolved as quickly and fairly as possible; therefore, the LCOHA supports an "open-communication policy" to encourage addressing these issues. The following "Problem Solving Process" has been designed to provide guidelines for resolution of questions, problems or conflicts:</p>

Problems arise in all work places and this process is designated to identify and correct those problems and issues in a fair, equitable and timely manner. It should be noted that not all problems or issues will have an outcome that all parties agree with but in no circumstances will insubordinate behavior or communications be tolerated.</p>

Pursuant to the Amended Constitution and Bylaws of the Tribe, ultimate legal and fiscal responsibility of the Tribe is with the Tribal Governing Board, as the elected representatives of the members of the Tribe. The Tribal Governing Board possesses the inherent sovereign authority to delegate oversight and management responsibilities to program directors for the planning and daily operations of Tribal programs and entities. The Tribal Court interprets and enforces, in accordance with and subject to applicable law, as well as these policies and procedures established by the Tribal Governing Board.</p>

                <p>The LCO-CHC is a public body established as a subordinate entity of the Tribe pursuant to Title III, Chapter 5 of the LCOTCL – Community Health Center Code. The Tribe is a sovereign nation, with inherent reserved rights recognized through federal treaties; as such the tribe exists within the geographical boundaries of the United States. Immunity from private lawsuits is one aspect of inherent tribal sovereignty. Pursuant to <a class="internal-link " href="/us/nsn/lco/council/code/IIchapter/5" title="Chapter 5 Sovereign Immunity Code of The Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians">Title II, Chapter 5</a> of the LCOTCL – Sovereign Immunity Code, immunity from suit means that no private lawsuit can be maintained against the Tribe or any of its subordinate entities such as the LCO-CHC, unless the Tribe consents to the action.

                <p>It is the general policy of the LCO-CHC to extend to its employees, where possible, the rights and benefits provided by employers regulated by the laws of the United States. However, the LCO-CHC looks to federal employment laws as guidelines only, and nothing in this personnel policy and procedural manual shall be construed as the LCO-CHC's consent to application of such laws. Another aspect of the Tribe's inherent sovereignty is that Wisconsin Statutes are not applicable on Tribal operations without the express written permission of the Tribal Governing Board.

While on unpaid leave, the employee must continue to make this payment, either in person or by mail. The payment must be received by the first day of each month. If the payment is more than thirty (30) days late, the employee's health care coverage may be dropped for the duration of the leave.</p>

                <p>The Tribe recognizes that individual employees may develop personal problems which could have negative effects on job performance. The Tribe offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for all employees, the purpose of which is to encourage the early diagnosis and treatment of personal, psychological, and medical problems. Employees are encouraged to contact the Human Resource Director, or designee, for information regarding the EAP. Employees are responsible for submission of all documents and paperwork to pay the costs incurred for services rendered in connection with the EAP. Employees may utilize their health insurance plan as coverage is available; otherwise the service will be self-pay. Employees may attend a scheduled EAP appointment with the LCO-CHC during work hours. If the EAP appointment is at another facility the employee may use permitted paid or unpaid leave for EAP absences. EAP appointments (that the employee is required to attend by the Employer) will be coordinated with the employee's supervisor so customer service does not get interrupted.</p>

Nothing precludes the Human Resource Director, or designee, in testing for substances which are not included on this list, should the Health Director, or designee, determine it is in the best interests of the Tribe to include substances which are not listed above to ensure a drug free workplace. Employees are encouraged to contact the Human Resource Director, or designee, with any questions regarding drug and alcohol testing. Failure or refusal to participate in an employer-directed drug test is considered insubordination and the employee will be terminated for insubordination.</p>

Scrub uniforms and closed shoes for medical staff, business casual for all other staff (example would be khakis, dress pants, nice sweater, blouses, but absolutely no obscene or graphic shirts, shorts, or flip-flops).

                <p>The Tribe recognizes that individual employees may develop personal problems which could have negative effects on job performance. The Tribe offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for all employees, the purpose of which is to encourage the early diagnosis and treatment of personal, psychological, and medical problems. Employees are encouraged to contact the Human Resource Director, or designee, for information regarding the EAP. Employees are responsible for submission of all documents and paperwork to pay the costs incurred for services rendered in connection with the EAP. Employees may utilize their health insurance plan as coverage is available; otherwise the service will be self-pay. Employees may attend a scheduled EAP appointment with the LCO-CHC during work hours. If the EAP appointment is at another facility the employee may use permitted paid or unpaid leave for EAP absences. EAP appointments (that the employee is required to attend by the Employer) will be coordinated with the employee's supervisor so customer service does not get interrupted.</p>

                <p>Employees are not permitted to engage in nepotism, favoritism, and any outside business transactions, or other activities, which are detrimental to the best interests of the School. This includes activities that, directly or indirectly, divert business opportunities from the School or confer an unfair advantage upon or benefit to a family member. It also includes activities that negatively reflect upon the School's image or are contrary to the mission of the School, except for activities specifically protected by law. The School respects the right of employees to engage in activities outside their employment that are of a private nature and unrelated to their job or the School. However, employees must fully disclose to their department head or director or the Human Resource Director, or designee, all business and personal activities that represent such a conflict of interest with the School. If an employee is unsure whether a conflict of interest exists, the employee is encouraged to seek the advice of the Human Resource Director, or designee.</p>

The School considers all full time employees' work with the School to be their primary employment responsibility.

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="/us/nsn/lco/council/code/XIVchapter/7/subchapter/7.13/section/7.1309#(2)(b)">(b)</span> The training is directly related to the employee's job if it is designed to make the employee handle his job more effectively as distinguished from training him for another job, or to a new or additional skill.  For example, a stenographer who is given a course in stenography is engaged in an activity to make her a better stenographer. Time spent in such a course given by the employer or under his auspices is hours worked. However, if the stenographer takes a course in bookkeeping, it may not be directly related to her job. Thus, the time she spends voluntarily in taking such a bookkeeping course, outside of regular working hours, need not be counted as working time. Where a training course is instituted for the bona fide purpose of preparing for advancement through upgrading the employee to a higher skill, and is not intended to make the employee more efficient in his present job, the training is not considered directly related to the employee's job even though the course incidentally improves his skill in doing his regular work.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="/us/nsn/lco/council/code/XIVchapter/7/subchapter/7.13/section/7.1309#(2)(c)">(c)</span> If an employee on his own initiative attends an independent school, college or independent trade school after hours, the time is not hours worked for his employer even if the courses are related to his job.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="/us/nsn/lco/council/code/XIVchapter/7/subchapter/7.13/section/7.1309#(2)(d)">(d)</span> There are some special situations where the time spent in attending lectures, training sessions and courses of instruction is not regarded as hours worked. For example, an employer may establish for the benefit of his employees a program of instruction that corresponds to courses offered by independent bona fide institutions of learning. Voluntary attendance by an employee at such courses outside of working hours would not be hours worked even if they are directly related to his job, or paid for by the employer.</p>

                <p>The Tribal Governing Board is the governing body of the Tribe. Pursuant to the Amended Constitution and Bylaws of the Tribe, ultimate legal and fiscal responsibility of the Tribe is with the Tribal Governing Board, as the elected representatives of the members of the Tribe. The Tribal Governing Board possesses the inherent sovereign authority to delegate oversight and management responsibilities to program directors for the planning and daily operations of Tribal programs and entities. The Tribal Court interprets and enforces, in accordance with and subject to applicable law, as well as these policies and procedures established by the Tribal Governing Board.</p>

                <p>The Gaming Enterprises are a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Tribe established pursuant to <a class="internal-link " href="/us/nsn/lco/council/code/XIIchapter/1" title="Chapter 1 Gaming Code of The Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians">Title XII, Chapter 1</a> of the LCOTCL – Gaming Code. The Tribe is a sovereign nation, with inherent reserved rights recognized through federal treaties; as such the tribe exists within the geographical boundaries of the United States. Immunity from private lawsuits is one aspect of inherent tribal sovereignty. Pursuant to <a class="internal-link " href="/us/nsn/lco/council/code/IIchapter/5" title="Chapter 5 Sovereign Immunity Code of The Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians">Title II, Chapter 5</a> of the LCOTCL – Sovereign Immunity Code, immunity from suit means that no private lawsuit can be maintained against the Tribe or any of its subordinate entities such as the Gaming Enterprises, unless the Tribe consents to the action. Nothing in this manual, including without limitation the provisions of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/lco/council/code/XIVchapter/9/subchapter/9.12" title="Subchapter 9.12 Conduct / Performance Infractions, Progressive Discipline and Appeal">Subchapter 9.12</a>, constitutes a waiver of the Tribe's inherent sovereign immunity.</p>

                <p>It is the general policy of the Gaming Enterprises to extend to its employees, where possible, the rights and benefits provided by employers regulated by the laws of the United States. However, the Gaming Enterprises looks to federal employment laws as guidelines only, and nothing in this personnel policy and procedural manual shall be construed as the Gaming Enterprises' consent to application of such laws. Another aspect of the Tribe's inherent sovereignty is that Wisconsin Statutes are not applicable on Tribal operations without the express written permission of the Tribal Governing Board. The Tribe reserves the right to create and modify its employment laws and policies without regard to such laws or interpretations thereof.</p>

The Tribal Governing Board possesses the inherent sovereign authority to delegate oversight and management responsibilities to program directors for the planning and daily operations of Tribal programs and entities.

Immunity from suit means that no private lawsuit can be maintained against the Tribe unless the Tribe consents to the action.

Another aspect of the Tribe's inherent sovereignty is that Wisconsin Statutes are not applicable on Tribal operations without the express written permission of the Tribal Governing Board.

                <p>The LCO Development Corporation recognizes that individual employees may develop personal problems which could have negative effects on job performance. The LCO Development Corporation offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for all employees, the purpose of which is to encourage the early diagnosis and treatment of personal, psychological, and medical problems. Employees are encouraged to contact the Human Resource Director, or designee, for information regarding the EAP. Employees are responsible for submission of all documents and paperwork to pay the costs incurred for services rendered in connection with the EAP. Employees may utilize their health insurance plan as coverage is available; otherwise the service will be self-pay. Employees may attend a scheduled EAP appointment with the LCO Clinic during work hours.

                <p>All employees and applicants for employment are subject to drug and alcohol testing, including reasonable suspicion, pre-employment, and return-to-duty. Drug tests require laboratory testing as provided by the Mandatory guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs pursuant to 94 FR 28101, May 15, 2015 as amended, as minimum standards for the following classes of drug and correlative cutoff concentrations: Cocaine; Opiates including opium and codeine derivatives such as Oxycodone, Oxymorphone, Hydrocodone, Hydromorphone; Amphetamines and Methamphetamines including Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) and Methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA); Phencyclidine (PCP). Nothing precludes the Human Resource Director, or designee, in testing for substances which are not included on this list, should the Superintendent, or designee, determine it is in the best interests of the Tribe to include substances which are not listed above to ensure a drug free workplace. Employees are encouraged to contact the Human Resource Director, or designee, with any questions regarding drug and alcohol testing. Failure or refusal to participate in an employer-directed drug test is considered insubordination and the employee will be terminated for insubordination.</p>

However, the BFGC looks to federal employment laws as guidelines only, and nothing in this personnel policy and procedural manual shall be construed as the BFGC's consent to application of such laws. Another aspect of BFGC's inherent sovereignty is that Wisconsin Statutes are not applicable to the operations of the BFGC without the express written permission of the Big Fish Golf Corp.
