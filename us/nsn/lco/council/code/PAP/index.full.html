Employees are responsible for submission of all documents and paperwork to pay the costs incurred for services rendered in connection with the EAP. Employees may utilize their health insurance plan as coverage is available; otherwise the service will be self-pay. Employees may attend a scheduled EAP appointment with the LCO-CHC during work hours. If the EAP appointment is at another facility the employee may use permitted paid or unpaid leave for EAP absences.

                <p>
                  <strong>INDIAN PREFERENCE:</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Eligibility for Indian preference shall be established in accordance with the requirements of federal law. If the Tribe or its prime contractor determines an applicant ineligible for Indian preference, the Tribe or its prime contractor shall notify the applicant in writing before contract award, or filling the position, or providing the desired training.</p>
                <p>The Tribe may restrict procurement activity to eligible Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises.</p>
                <p><strong>Restricted Solicitations.</strong>  The Tribe may provide Indian preference in procurement activities by advertising for bids or proposals from only qualified Indian organizations and Indian owned-enterprises.  Or, the Tribe may use a two-stage preference procedure.  The regulations describe the two-stage procedure as follows:</p>
                <p><strong>Stage 1.</strong> Invite or otherwise solicit Indian-owned economic enterprises to submit a statement of intent to respond to a bid announcement or request for proposals limited to Indian-owned firms.</p>
                <p><strong>Stage 2.</strong> If responses are received from more than one Indian enterprise found to be qualified, advertise for bids or proposals limited to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises.</p>
                <p>If the solicitation is restricted to qualified Indian owned economic enterprises and organizations, and two or more (or a greater number determined by the Tribe and stated in the invitation) qualified Indian owned economic enterprises or organizations submit responsive bids, award shall be made to the qualified enterprise or organization with the lowest responsive bid.  If equal low bids are received, drawing lots or similar random method shall make award, unless otherwise provided in state, tribal, or local law.  If fewer than the minimum number of qualified Indian owned economic enterprises or organizations submit responsive bids, all bids shall be rejected, and the Tribe shall cancel the solicitation.  The Tribe may accept a single bid received from a responsible bidder, subject to HUD approval for HUD projects, in unusual circumstances, such as if the Tribe determines that, based on a cost or price analysis, the bid price is fair and reasonable, or the Tribe determines that the delay of re-soliciting would subject the project to higher costs.</p>
                <p>Unrestricted Solicitations.  If the Tribe isn't able to award a contract based on the procedures described in the previous section, the Tribe shall re-advertise the contract inviting bids from non-Indians as well as Indian owned economic enterprises or organizations.</p>
                <p>The Tribe may require information from prospective contractors seeking to qualify as Indian organizations or Indian-owned economic enterprises.</p>
                <p>Complaints arising from any of the methods the Tribe utilizes to implement Indian preference shall be conducted in accordance with this ordinance.</p>
                <p>
                  <em>Award shall be made under unrestricted solicitations to the lowest responsive bid from a qualified Indian-owned economic enterprise or organization within the maximum total contract price established for the specific project or activity being solicited, if the bid is no more than 15% higher than the total bid price of the lowest responsive bid from any qualified bidder.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>If the bid from the qualified Indian-owned economic enterprise of organization is within the (15%) range of the lowest, non-Indian firm, the Indian-owned firm will be given the opportunity to meet the lowest bid price. Should the Indian-owned firm refuse to meet this lower price, the bid shall then be awarded to the responsive and responsible low bidder for the project.</em>

                <p>All tribal entities involved in preparing, authorizing and processing travel requests shall exercise sound business judgment in preparing and authorizing travel requests. Travel shall be via the lowest reasonable cost alternative to minimize expense. In incurring travel expenses, all employees shall be as conservative as possible consistent with sound business/ cost control practices. The Travel/Purchase Clerk may assume that, if a practice or policy or procedure is in the best interests of the Tribe and is not addressed in this ordinance, nor prohibited by tribal law, federal law, or other directive including this travel policy and procedure manual, the practice, policy or procedure may be a permissible exercise of authority. The Travel/Purchase Clerk is advised to seek advice from the Executive Director or Tribal Governing Board liaison whenever doubts arise about an intended practice, policy or procedure. In circumstance where a conflict of interest may exist between the Executive Director and an employee, then the Travel/Purchase Clerk shall seek advice directly from the Tribal Governing Board liaison.</p>

                <p>The Tribe recognizes that individual employees may develop personal problems which could have negative effects on job performance. The Tribe offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for all employees, the purpose of which is to encourage the early diagnosis and treatment of personal, psychological, and medical problems. Employees are encouraged to contact the Human Resource Director, or designee, for information regarding the EAP. Employees are responsible for submission of all documents and paperwork to pay the costs incurred for services rendered in connection with the EAP. Employees may utilize their health insurance plan as coverage is available; otherwise the service will be self-pay. Employees may attend a scheduled EAP appointment with the LCO-CHC during work hours. If the EAP appointment is at another facility the employee may use permitted paid or unpaid leave for EAP absences. EAP appointments (that the employee is required to attend by the Employer) will be coordinated with the employee's supervisor so customer service does not get interrupted.</p>

The Tribal Governing Board possesses the inherent sovereign authority to delegate oversight and management responsibilities to program directors for the planning and daily operations of Tribal programs and entities.

                <p>The LCO-CHC is a public body established as a subordinate entity of the Tribe pursuant to Title III, Chapter 5 of the LCOTCL – Community Health Center Code. The Tribe is a sovereign nation, with inherent reserved rights recognized through federal treaties; as such the tribe exists within the geographical boundaries of the United States. Immunity from private lawsuits is one aspect of inherent tribal sovereignty.

However, the LCO-CHC looks to federal employment laws as guidelines only, and nothing in this personnel policy and procedural manual shall be construed as the LCO-CHC's consent to application of such laws.

                <p>The Tribe recognizes that individual employees may develop personal problems which could have negative effects on job performance. The Tribe offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for all employees, the purpose of which is to encourage the early diagnosis and treatment of personal, psychological, and medical problems. Employees are encouraged to contact the Human Resource Director, or designee, for information regarding the EAP. Employees are responsible for submission of all documents and paperwork to pay the costs incurred for services rendered in connection with the EAP. Employees may utilize their health insurance plan as coverage is available; otherwise the service will be self-pay. Employees may attend a scheduled EAP appointment with the LCO-CHC during work hours. If the EAP appointment is at another facility the employee may use permitted paid or unpaid leave for EAP absences. EAP appointments (that the employee is required to attend by the Employer) will be coordinated with the employee's supervisor so customer service does not get interrupted.</p>

                <p>The LCO-CHC is an ambulatory health care facility with multiple departments tasked with serving the health care need of the Native American population of the LCO-CHC.

We can contribute to the center's image by taking pride in our own appearance.</p>

Thus all staff members are expected to dress in professional or business casual attire. In general, business casual means dressing professionally, looking relaxed yet neat and pulled together and no visible hickies and facial piercings. Scrub uniforms and closed shoes for medical staff, business casual for all other staff (example would be khakis, dress pants, nice sweater, blouses, but absolutely no obscene or graphic shirts, shorts, or flip-flops). Blue jeans without rips will be permitted only on casual Fridays or by Maintenance staff. Sports Jerseys/shirts are allowed on Fridays or designated game day.</p>

Supervisors will have the authority and responsibility to enforce this policy, and subsequent action required. This policy is applicable on all shifts, seven days a week. Departments may establish more specific guidelines consistent with this policy. Variances to this policy may be implemented by specific departments at the discretion of the departmental supervisor and approval by the Health Director as needed to ensure the safety of their staff, and will be implemented in conjunction with PPE (Personnel Protective Equipment) related requirements, as required by relevant OSHA and infection control standards, and as specified in individual departmental manuals requiring specific PPE equipment.</p>

                <p>Punctuality and regular attendance are essential to the effective operation of the School.  Employees must report to work on time. Any employee who will be absent from work must notify the office manager in the administration office (for LCO School mainstream track employees) or the administrative assistant (for Waadookodaading immersion track employees), no later than sixty (60) minutes prior to their respective scheduled start time for instructional staff, and no later than thirty (30) minutes prior to their respective scheduled start time for non-instructional staff. If an employee cannot speak with the office manager in the administration office (for LCO School mainstream track employees) or the administrative assistant (for Waadookodaading immersion track employees), it is the employee's responsibility to speak with their department head or director. All employees must sign-in upon arrival if they arrive after their respective scheduled start time. Any employee who leaves campus for any reason must have prior approval from his or her department head or director, sign out and sign in upon return. Repeated instances of failure to report, regardless of the duration will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination. Failure to report to work, without notice, for three consecutive working days will be considered job abandonment and the employee will be considered to have resigned from the School. Job abandonment will not be subject to any appeal provisions and shall be subject to the provisions of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/lco/council/code/PAPchapter/PAP.7/subchapter/PAP.7.5/section/PAP.7.5.080" title="PAP.7.5.080 Resignations">Section PAP.7.5.080</a> of this manual.</p>

                <p>The Tribe recognizes that individual employees may develop personal problems which could have negative effects on job performance. The Tribe offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for all employees, the purpose of which is to encourage the early diagnosis and treatment of personal, psychological, and medical problems. Employees are encouraged to contact the Human Resource Director, or designee, for information regarding the EAP. Employees are responsible for submission of all documents and paperwork to pay the costs incurred for services rendered in connection with the EAP. Employees may utilize their health insurance plan as coverage is available; otherwise the service will be self-pay. Employees may attend a scheduled EAP appointment with the LCO-CHC during work hours. If the EAP appointment is at another facility the employee may use permitted paid or unpaid leave for EAP absences. EAP appointments (that the employee is required to attend by the Employer) will be coordinated with the employee's supervisor so customer service does not get interrupted.</p>

                <p>All employees and applicants for employment are subject to drug and alcohol testing, including reasonable suspicion, pre-employment, return-to-duty. Drug tests require laboratory testing as provided by the Mandatory guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs pursuant to 94 FR 28101, May 15, 2015 as amended, as minimum standards for the following classes of drug and correlative cutoff concentrations: Cocaine; Opiates including opium and codeine derivatives such as Oxycodone, Oxymorphone, Hydrocodone, Hydromorphone; Amphetamines and Methamphetamines including Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) and Methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA); Phencyclidine (PCP). Nothing precludes the Human Resource Director, or designee, in testing for substances which are not included on this list, should the School Director, or designee, determine it is in the best interests of the Tribe to include substances which are not listed above to ensure a drug free workplace. Employees are encouraged to contact the Human Resource Director, or designee, with any questions regarding drug and alcohol testing. Failure or refusal to participate in an employer-directed drug test is considered insubordination and the employee will be terminated for insubordination.</p>

For example, a stenographer who is given a course in stenography is engaged in an activity to make her a better stenographer. Time spent in such a course given by the employer or under his auspices is hours worked. However, if the stenographer takes a course in bookkeeping, it may not be directly related to her job. Thus, the time she spends voluntarily in taking such a bookkeeping course, outside of regular working hours, need not be counted as working time. Where a training course is instituted for the bona fide purpose of preparing for advancement through upgrading the employee to a higher skill, and is not intended to make the employee more efficient in his present job, the training is not considered directly related to the employee's job even though the course incidentally improves his skill in doing his regular work.</p>

For example, an employer may establish for the benefit of his employees a program of instruction that corresponds to courses offered by independent bona fide institutions of learning. Voluntary attendance by an employee at such courses outside of working hours would not be hours worked even if they are directly related to his job, or paid for by the employer.</p>

Pursuant to <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/lco/council/code/TCTchapter/TCT.5" title="Chapter TCT.5 Sovereign Immunity Code Of The Lac Courte Oreilles Band Of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians">Chapter TCT.5</a> of the LCOTCL – Sovereign Immunity Code, immunity from suit means that no private lawsuit can be maintained against the Tribe or any of its subordinate entities such as the Gaming Enterprises, unless the Tribe consents to the action. Nothing in this manual, including without limitation the provisions of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/lco/council/code/PAPchapter/PAP.9/subchapter/PAP.9.12" title="Subchapter PAP.9.12 Conduct / Performance Infractions, Progressive Discipline And Appeal">Subchapter PAP.9.12</a>, constitutes a waiver of the Tribe's inherent sovereign immunity.</p>

                <p>It is the general policy of the Gaming Enterprises to extend to its employees, where possible, the rights and benefits provided by employers regulated by the laws of the United States. However, the Gaming Enterprises looks to federal employment laws as guidelines only, and nothing in this personnel policy and procedural manual shall be construed as the Gaming Enterprises' consent to application of such laws. Another aspect of the Tribe's inherent sovereignty is that Wisconsin Statutes are not applicable on Tribal operations without the express written permission of the Tribal Governing Board. The Tribe reserves the right to create and modify its employment laws and policies without regard to such laws or interpretations thereof.</p>

In certain situations, where managers believe it would be in the Employer's best interest to ask a team member who has given a notice of resignation to separate immediately, the Employer may or may not authorize payment of the remainder of the team member's scheduled time.</p>

EAP provides referrals to local community treatment sources and all visits are held in confidence.

Participation in EAP does not excuse team members from complying with the provisions of this ordinance or from meeting normal job requirements during or after receiving assistance.  Nor will participation in our EAP prevent the Gaming Enterprises from taking disciplinary action against any team member for performance problems that occur before or after the team member's seeking assistance through the program.

                <p>The LCO Development Corporation recognizes that individual employees may develop personal problems which could have negative effects on job performance. The LCO Development Corporation offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for all employees, the purpose of which is to encourage the early diagnosis and treatment of personal, psychological, and medical problems. Employees are encouraged to contact the Human Resource Director, or designee, for information regarding the EAP. Employees are responsible for submission of all documents and paperwork to pay the costs incurred for services rendered in connection with the EAP. Employees may utilize their health insurance plan as coverage is available; otherwise the service will be self-pay. Employees may attend a scheduled EAP appointment with the LCO Clinic during work hours. If the EAP appointment is at another facility the employee may use permitted paid or unpaid leave for EAP absences. EAP appointments (that the employee is required to attend by the Employer) will be coordinated with the employee's supervisor so customer service does not get interrupted.</p>

                <p>The Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians (hereinafter "Band" or "Tribe") in an effort to diversify the economy of the Tribe's reservation in order to improve the Tribe's economic self-sufficiency petitioned the Secretary of the Interior to issue a charter of corporation pursuant to section 17 of the Indian Reorganization Act, codified at U.S.C. § 5124. The BIA – Midwest Regional Office issued a certificate of incorporation for the Big Fish Golf Corporation (hereinafter "Big Fish Golf Corp" or "BFGC"). Big Fish Golf Corp is a legal entity wholly owned by the Tribe, but distinct and separate from the Tribe.</p>
                <p>This personnel policy and procedural manual is enacted pursuant to the management authority of the Board of Directors of the Big Fish Golf Corp. This personnel and procedure manual outlines the general policies, rules and procedures and is intended to be a helpful reference during your employment with the BFGC. The information contained herein is general information, and its contents do not create or constitute a contract between BFGC and any employee. The Board of Directors acting in its management capacity may in its sole discretion amend this personnel policy and procedural manual from time to time.</p>
